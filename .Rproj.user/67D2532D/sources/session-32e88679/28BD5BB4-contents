# 1. Motivation

The Verde River is in central Arizona and its watershed drains over 4
million acres. Elevations range from over 3650 m ASL in the San
Francisco Peaks to about 1300ft ASL at its confluence with the Salt
River. The Verde River gains volume from a string of canyons with
perennial tributaries. These include Sycamore, Wet Beaver, Oak, and West
Clear creeks. These perennial tributaries get large portions of their
base flow from springs discharging from the regional aquifers
(Ecological Implications of Verde River Flows, 2008).

Figure 1. Map of the Verde River watershed and study sites

The Verde Wild and Scenic (W&S) River extends from Beasley RAP to Sheep
Bridge Dispersed Camping area just above Horseshoe Reservoir (Figure 1
). The river is isolated and generally inaccessible by road along this
reach. The region is rugged and arid with Fossil Creek and the
intermittent East Verde River contributing flow to the river. After the
W&S portion of the river, the Verde enters Horseshoe Reservoir, the
first of two large storage reservoirs on the river. Shortly after
Horseshoe Reservoir the river flows into Bartlett Reservoir and then
joins the Salt River just northeast of the Phoenix metropolitan area.
Although there are no large storage reservoirs above the Verde River
Wild and Scenic Corridor, the Verde River is still impacted by human
use. Base flow in the upper Verde Valley comes mainly from the Big Chino
and Little Chino aquifers (Wirt, DeWitt, and Langenheim 2005). These
aquifers are pumped by municipal, irrigation, and domestic wells near in
the Little Chino Basin. Perennial flow in the Verde begins about 5 miles
lower downstream than it did historically (Ecological Implications of
Verde River Flows , 2008). Surface water diversions between Clarkdale
and Beasley RAP reduce base flow during the summer when water levels are
historically at their lowest. In total, irrigation ditches withdraw
about 34,000 acre feet with about half of that being consumed (Alam
1997; Blasch et al. 2006) . The Verde Valley also is an agricultural
area with land being used for: pasture, pecans, grapes, corn, and
vegetables. However, most farms are small both in size and revenue
(USDA, 2012)

## Background

Riparian forests in Arizona are disproportionately important to the
landscape despite their relatively small geographic area. Riparian
forests in Arizona cover only about 0.4% of the land surface area yet
support more biodiversity and ecosystem functions than surrounding
upland habitat (Ffolliott et al. 2004). In Arizona, 80 percent of all
vertebrate species complete a part of their lifecycle in riparian areas
(Hubbard, 1977). Riparian forest:s support and enhance terrestrial and
aquatic habitat, filter upland sediment and nutrients, store water and
recharge aquifers and stabilize stream banks among many other functions
(Schultz et al. 2009).

Fremont Cottonwood (*Populus fremontii*) and Gooding Willow (*Salix
goodingii*) are major components of riparian forests along the Verde
River . Tree diversity is low in Verde River riparian forests with
Fremont Cottonwood and Gooding Willows being the dominant species.

The reproductive ecology of cottonwood and willow influences how and
when they regenerate. These trees are pioneer species, meaning they rely
on disturbance and Riparian forest regeneration is limited by several
natural and anthropomorphic causes. Summer drought, along with summer
and fall floods, are leading causes of seedling mortality. Seedling
roots must grow fast enough to maintain access to soil water as the
water table drops throughout spring and summer and returns to base--flow
conditions (Stromberg, 1993). Humans altering natural flow regimes have
been detrimental to riparian forest regeneration. Water diversions
reduce stream flow beginning in spring and continuing through the
summer. Stream diversions lower water levels in streams as cottonwood
and willow seedlings are trying to reach the water table before they dry
out. Further impacts are from dams that trap sediment and reduce the
amount and variability of flow during winter floods. These floods are
fundamental for carrying sediment and nutrients downstream as well as
scouring out new habitat for seeds to germinate on (Stromberg, 1997).

The winter of 2023 produced the largest floods along the Verde River in
30 years. Flows peaked at over 50,000 CFS near Camp Verde, AZ. This was
a large enough disturbance to: remove vegetation, topple trees, scour
new channels and deposit fresh sediment. This allowed Fremont
Cottonwoods to regenerate for the first time in about 15 years.

## Question

Cottonwood growth and regeneration along the Verde River have yet to
studied.These forests are not only important politically because of the
Wild and Scenic designation, but also ecologically. Understanding what
influences survival and how quickly cottonwoods grow is key to ensuring
that they persist into the future.

## Dataset

The dataset was collected via field work at Beasley River Access Point
(BRAP) near Camp Verde ,Arizona. Plots Ten regeneration plots were
established in Fall 2023 and initially surveyed. The height in
centimeters and the diameter in millimeters of each seedling was
measured in a plot.Plots that were too large or had too many seedlings
were sampled. The height-diameter ratio (HDR) was then calculated by
dividing the height of each seedling (in mm) by its diameter (in mm) to
give me a single metric of seedling size. A larger HDR indicates a
taller, skinnier seedling.The sites were then visited in Spring of 2024
and Fall of 2024. This gave me seedling size and density changes between
all visits. Survey Data In winter of 2024 a shallow groundwater well was
installed in the alluvial, floodplain aquifer and a HOBO WL13 logger was
activated which took groundwater measurements every hour. In summer of
2024, members of the larger Forest Service Gila River adjudication team
came to flagstaff to help with the project. They brought survey caliber
GNSS equipment. With this equipment we were able to precisely measure
the plot elevations and locations. This gave me my variables: distance
to river, difference between plot elevation and river stage, and
elevation of plot above the groundwater table.

The seedling dataset is accurate and precisely measured. However, as
with any sampling method, not all seedlings on a river reach are
measured. This means that we are hoping that the seedlings measured are
representative of the entire river reach.The survey data is highly
reliable and accurate but because of equipment restraints, the same
equipment wont be able to be used at my other site.

## Methodology

## Seedling statistics For seedling size metrics,I used an Analysis of

Variance (ANOVA test). I used this test because: I have more than 2
variables at more than 2 times and each visit has a different amount of
seedlings. One weakness with this analysis is that it ideally uses
normally distributed data which only one of my variables (HDR) is. The
ANOVA test is also helpful because it tells me which variables are
statistically significant which is necessary in ecology.

## Survey Variables

The survey variables were compared to seedling survivorship (as a percent from original survey). A Spearman correlation
was used because I need to know if the correlations are statistically
significant. Also the Spearman correlation was used because I was unsure
if the trends were linear in nature.

## Hypothesis

I hypothesize that: 1) Height will increase the fastest because pioneer
species like cottonwoods need to get above competition before they are
shaded out. 2) Height above groundwater level will be the most
significant factor in seedling survivalship.Fremont Cottonwoods need to
be connected to perennial water due to their high evapotranspiration
rates so if they are too far removed from the water table, they
desiccate quickly.

## Results/Discussion 
### Growth

```{r Table 1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Calculate mean for each Variable and Date
mean_values <- long_data %>%
  mutate(Date = dmy(paste("15", Date))) %>%  
  group_by(Variable, Date) %>%  # Group by Variable and Date
  summarise(Mean_Value = mean(Value, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") %>%  
  arrange(Variable, Date) %>%  # Ensure data is sorted by Variable and Date
  group_by(Variable) %>%  # Regroup by Variable
  mutate(Percentage_Change = (Mean_Value - lag(Mean_Value)) / lag(Mean_Value) * 100) %>%  
  ungroup() %>%  # Remove grouping
  arrange(Variable, Date)  # Final sort by Variable and Date for display


mean_values %>%
  kable("html", caption = "Changes in seedling growth") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)

```

This table shows the percent increases between of each variable. All
size metrics increased between each visit. Height increased by about 30%
each visit while HDR increased at a rapid rate between Spring and Fall
of 2024. Diameter had the opposite trend, increasing the most between
Fall 2023 and Spring 2024. This could indicate that changes in size distribution are caused mainly by increases in height.

```{r Size Plots, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(long_data, aes(x = Value, fill = Variable)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, alpha = 0.7, position = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~ Variable, scales = "free") +
  labs(
    title = "Histograms of Diameter, Height, and HDR",
    x = "Value",
    y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

This chart shows a little about the size structure of the seedlings.
Neither diameter or height are normally distributed. However, when you
convert the to the same units and then divide them, you get a size
structure that is more or less normally distributed.This indicates that
seedling size and their growth on a plot level follows a normal
distribution.

### ANOVA and Tukey Table

```{r}
# Run ANOVA model
anova_model <- aov(Value ~ Variable * Date, data = long_data)
tukey_results <- TukeyHSD(anova_model)

# Function to extract Tukey's results into a data frame
extract_tukey_results <- function(tukey_result, comparison_name) {
  if (comparison_name %in% names(tukey_result)) {
    tukey_df <- as.data.frame(tukey_result[[comparison_name]])
    if (nrow(tukey_df) > 0) {
      tukey_df$Comparison <- rownames(tukey_df)
      rownames(tukey_df) <- NULL
      colnames(tukey_df) <- c("Estimate", "Lower_CI", "Upper_CI", "P_Value", "Comparison")
      return(tukey_df[, c("Comparison", "Estimate", "Lower_CI", "Upper_CI", "P_Value")])
    }
  }
  return(data.frame(Comparison = NA, Estimate = NA, Lower_CI = NA, Upper_CI = NA, P_Value = NA))
}
# Extract Tukey results for the interaction term
tukey_results_interaction_df <- extract_tukey_results(tukey_results, "Variable:Date")
selected_rows <- c(3, 6, 11, 14, 18, 21, 24, 29, 33)
selected_data <- data.frame()
# Loop through the selected rows and add them to the data frame
for (row in selected_rows) {
  if (row <= nrow(tukey_results_interaction_df)) {
    selected_data <- rbind(selected_data, tukey_results_interaction_df[row, ])
  }
}

# Generate the kable table
selected_data %>%
  kable("html", caption = "Selected Rows from Tukey Test") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) %>%
  row_spec(which(selected_data$P_Value < 0.05), background = "lightgreen")


```

The results of the ANOVA test and Tukey HSD test. Not all relationships
were relevant so just the key variable interactions were kept in the
final table. Relationships that had a P-value less than or equal to .05
were considered significant.Date was a significant factor for all 3
visits. All height changes between visits were significant. HDR changes
between Fall 2023 to Fall 2024 and Spring 2024 to Fall 2024 were
significant. None of the diameter changes were significant.The fact that
heights are increasing faster and more significantly supports my
hypothesis that seedlings are prioritizing growing taller rather than
wider in order to grow above their competition.

### Survey data

```{r}
# Target variable (change this to your actual target variable name)
target_var <- WellSurvey$`% Change from original survey`
column_names <- setdiff(names(WellSurvey), "target_var")
# Initialize an empty data frame to store results
cor_results <- data.frame(Variable = character(), Correlation = numeric(), P_Value = numeric(), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Loop through the list of variables to test correlation with the target
for (var_name in column_names) {
  current_var <- WellSurvey[[var_name]]
  if (is.numeric(current_var) && sum(complete.cases(current_var, target_var)) > 2) {
    # Perform Spearman correlation test
    cor_test <- tryCatch(
      cor.test(target_var, current_var, method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs"),
      error = function(e) NULL
    )
        if (!is.null(cor_test)) {
      cor_results <- rbind(cor_results, 
                           data.frame(Variable = var_name, 
                                      Correlation = cor_test$estimate, 
                                      P_Value = cor_test$p.value))
    }
  }
}


correlation_results <- data.frame(cor_results)
rownames(correlation_results) <- NULL
correlation_results <- correlation_results[-4,]

correlation_results %>%
  kable("html", caption = "Highlighted Rows Based on P-Value") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) %>%
  row_spec(which(correlation_results$P_Value < 0.05), background = "lightgreen")

```

As for the survey data, the only significant factor in seedling
survivorship was the difference between plot elevation and river stage.
Both distance to river and the elevation above groundwater level were
insignificant.This makes sense because rivers often have variable topography on their floodplain. Therefore, a plot can be a further distance from the active channel but still be very close to the water table.

This is a perennial river so it is baseflow and
groundwater fed. Because of this, I believe that river stage is general
elevation of the groundwater table at a certain elevation. Therefore,
the difference between plot elevation and river stage is more likely
measuring the elevation of the groundwater level too.

## Limitations

I believe that the groundwater level was poorly incorporated. Because
there is a single well and the plots are spread out over 100s of meters
the elevation of each plot is changing. Projecting the groundwater level
under a well hundreds of meters up and downstream of the well is going
to be inaccurate of where the groundwater level actually is. In addition, many plots saw multi-year recruitment. Seedlings regenerated again in the Spring of 2024. This not only increased densities at some plots but also caused an influx of seedlings with small diameters. This could be cause of diameters being smaller and the changes being insignificant. A committee member said that knowing if multi-year recruitment is happening is relevant so that they should not be excluded from the analysis.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, seedlings along the Verde Wild and Scenic river continue
to grow. Their heights increase the most and significantly as opposed to
their diameters. The only significant variable that I found to impact
their survivorship at a site is their elevation above the river (and
most likely groundwater) level. Future field work and analysis will
hopefully investigate other variables such as : soil texture, light
availability and herbaceous competition on seedling survival.
